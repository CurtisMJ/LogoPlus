    <string name="powerSaveDesc">When this option is toggled on, the passive effect will only run while the phone is unlocked. Notification effects will still run while locked. This can potentially save battery life.</string>
    <string name="pocketModeDesc">When this option is toggled on, the passive effect will be turned off if, to a degree of certainty, it is determined that the device is currently in a pocket or bag.\nThe criteria by which this is determined:\n\t- If the proximity sensor is covered\n\t- If the ambient light is low\n\t- If the phone is tilted so that one of its edges is facing downwards(in case the phone is placed face down on a surface, such as a table)\nAdditionally, these conditions are only checked 5 seconds after the screen turns off\n\nOnce the lights are turned off, the phone must be unlocked before they will re-activate. Notification effects are disabled along with the passive effect. This can potentially save battery life.</string>
